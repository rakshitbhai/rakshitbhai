## Profile

I am a Junior AI / ML Engineer with over 3 years of experience building production-grade applications and AI-enabled systems.  
My work focuses on **Applied NLP**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, and **backend AI systems** using **Python, FastAPI, and Docker**.

I am currently pursuing a **Master of Computer Applications (MCA)** and am seeking an **entry-level AI/ML or applied AI engineering role** in a product- or research-oriented team.

My primary interest is in **practical, reliable, and privacy-aware AI systems** rather than experimental or purely academic work.
